    Moenagade
    °°°°°°°°°

    Moenagade is a graphical programming tool for beginners. For this
    reason it is rather limited in its functionality. It aims to help
    students to gain knowledge about the programming structures. Due
    to the explicit conversion to real and executable Java code, it 
    should help to make an easy from block programming to coding.
    
    Projects saved with Moenagade can be opened, compiled and run with
    any of the following tools:
    
    - Unimozer
    - NetBeans
