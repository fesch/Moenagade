# Moenagade
Moenagade is a graphical programming tool for beginners. For this reason it is 
rather limited in its functionality. It aims to help students to gain knowledge 
about the programming structures. Due to the explicit conversion to real and 
executable Java code, it should help to make an easy from block programming to 
coding.

# Why having started this project?
Other bloc oriented programming tools do not provide some real-time conversion 
to Java code. As the latter is, in my personal opinion, rather important for
switching from the blocs to the code, I decided to write my own tool.

All Moenegade projects can be opened later either in NetBeans or in Unimozer.
